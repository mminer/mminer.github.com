title: "Wonderfully Weird VR Stock Photos"
---

That stock photos are often ridiculous is nothing new --- look no further than [Women Laughing Alone With Salad](https://www.thehairpin.com/2011/01/women-laughing-alone-with-salad/) to convince yourself --- but those that depict people experiencing virtual reality can be especially absurd.

There's a plethora of models waving their hands around like Tom Cruise in *Minority Report*, naturally, and countless shots where the subject's mouth [hangs wide open](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/20bqyw/mouths_close_them/) as VR blows their mind all the way to Halifax, but there are also scores of photos that are just... well, *bonkers* describes them best.

Take, for instance, this man inexplicably hanging wallpaper while wearing a VR headset:

<img alt="Man hanging wallpaper while wearing VR headset" srcset="/images/vr-wallpapering.jpg 1x, /images/vr-wallpapering@2x.jpg 2x" src="/images/vr-wallpapering.jpg">

Or how about this image a coworker recently shared of a woman biking through serene countryside with a Gear VR HMD casually strapped to her face:

<img alt="Woman riding bicycle while wearing VR headset" srcset="/images/vr-bicyclist-1.jpg 1x, /images/vr-bicyclist-1@2x.jpg 2x" src="/images/vr-bicyclist-1.jpg">

Operating a bicycle with completely obscured vision is preposterous, but I also marvel at the sheer difficulty of such a feat. Surprisingly, this isn't the only photo of somebody simultaneously riding a bike and experiencing VR.[^1]

Look at the sheer *joy* on this man's face. I may have just called the bicycle + VR combo preposterous, but this guy sells it. And it's not even the best one.

<img alt="Man riding bicycle while wearing VR headset... in a living room" srcset="/images/vr-bicyclist-3.jpg 1x, /images/vr-bicyclist-3@2x.jpg 2x" src="/images/vr-bicyclist-3.jpg">

The bicycle in the living room. The enthusiastically supportive friends. The ecstatic woman with the bowl of popcorn. I love every detail of this stock photo. If this charming scene doesn't convince you that virtual reality is the most electrifying technological development since Microsoft Bob, nothing will.

[^1]: Though two-wheeled cycles dominate. Try as I might, I failed to find a stock photo of somebody riding a unicycle while wearing a VR headset. I smell opportunity.
