This week, accompanied by hotshot game designer [Brad Keys](http://www.bradkeys.com/), I'll be attending Unite 2011 in San Francisco. Along with nerding out on topics as exhilarating as physics engines and particle effects, we'll be busting out [Lumos](http://www.uselumos.com/) for anyone interested in checking out the bee's knees of game analytics services. We have a couple sweet updates ready to ship, so it's guaranteed not to disappoint. I *promise*.

I'm jazzed to be attending the conference, it's been on my to-do list since the first one was put together years back. I don't know if my game design skills have improved since Unite 2007, but the engine sure has and I'm pumped to see what magic is unveiled this time around. According to my (deadly accurate) crystal ball, we're going to see announced the Apple II as a deployment platform in addition to a pink editor skin to complement the current pro "vampire" theme.

If you'd like to meet up with us to chat about Lumos, or about any other topic that strikes your fancy, send me a message at <matthew@matthewminer.com>. I look forward to meeting my fellow Unity aficionados.

See you there.
