Quick tip: if you're not a fan of the boilerplate code that Unity spits out when you create a new script (for example, if you'd rather have an `OnGUI` function ready to go rather than `Start`), you can easily change it to whatever suits you best. In Mac OS X, simply right click on the Unity application, choose "Show Package Contents," and navigate to *Contents & Resources*. You'll see three files named NewBehaviourScript. Open those up, modify them to your liking, and save. The next time you create a script in Unity, you'll notice with groundless excitement that your changes are there.
