title: "New Music Playlist: Upcoming Shows"
---

I'm constantly on the hunt for new music. My usual gotos are radio stations on Apple Music --- Elton John's *[Rocket Hour](https://music.apple.com/us/curator/rocket-hour/993269779)* for its eclectic selection, *[The Alligator Hour](https://music.apple.com/us/curator/the-alligator-hour/993270307)* for a weirder mix --- and free stations like *[Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com)*. Tim Bray's *[Song of the Day](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Song%20of%20the%20Day/)* blog posts were a particularly fertile source of recommendations while they lasted.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>

I recently went to a *Godspeed You! Black Emperor* concert and wondered how I would stumble on them if they weren't already in my library.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup> Countless other great bands are almost certainly playing blocks away but just never cross my radar. So my newest music-discovery-goto is compiling a playlist of bands visiting Vancouver in the near future and chucking it on at work.

The [Just Shows](http://justshows.com) RSS feed provides a solid directory of upcoming acts (though only for Canadian cities it seems). Once a week I look up the newly listed bands and enqueue their top hits. I really ought to automate this process. I'm told Apple Music has an API. Could happen.

The signal-to-noise ratio thus far is lower than I'd hoped. On the plus side, when I hear a band I enjoy I can see them live almost immediately. *And* I can pretend that I'm truly in the know when it comes to the local music scene. That's worth something.

Real bangers.<a href="#r1" class="return"></a></li>
    <li id="fn2">Theyâ€™re a bit obscure. I first listened to <em>GY!BE</em> on a recommendation from a floormate in university, when procrastinating on calc homework in favour of droning half hour instrumentals seemed like a fine use of time.<a href="#r2" class="return"></a></li>
