Unite 2011 left me exhausted and my voice decimated. It was awesome.

We (Brad Keys and myself) were there on business, pitching [Lumos](http://www.uselumos.com/) and game analytics to developers with flair that even Billy Mays can't top. We also sat in the sessions offered throughout the three days. Being the code lovers we are, we mostly attended the presentations related to programming. A common theme throughout was the difficulty of handling massive amounts of assets and the workflows that larger companies use for collaboration and testing. For someone whose games typically stay in the [graybox](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6504/a_game_studio_culture_dictionary.php "Game Studio Culture Dictionary") phase, this insight into how studios manage their gigabytes of data was fascinating. The takeaway was that the current release of Unity has difficulty coping with tons of assets, an issue that the keynote promised to alleviate with additions like the cache server and text-based scene files. The latter feature was met with loud cheers by the audience, so there's no doubt that Unity 3.5 will be a welcome update.

The most interesting session I attended was *Unity in the Wild*, a showcase of projects using Unity for non-game purposes, among them nature simulations and augmented reality for advertising. [Candy Stations](http://candystations.com/), a company producing live visualizations and performance art, was particularly fascinating. Unity is just one application of many that they employ to achieve their visually stunning displays. It opened my eyes to the possibility of piping video generated by an application like Quartz Composer or Max/Jitter directly into a Unity movie texture (a key component of this setup, by the way, is a tool called [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) that allows OS X applications to share video frames in realtime). I've always had the notion that Unity's powerful physics engine, lighting system, and 3D environment could be effectively used beyond games, and this session showed me that people are doing just that with incredible results. Just watch the Sufjan Stevens video on Candy Stations' website --- that's one psychedelic performance.

Something that impressed me about Unity as a company was their transparency. On the second day they hosted an off the record view into their roadmap, providing details about the current and future state of the engine. Developers were encouraged to voice their concerns and ask questions, which were answered frankly and honestly by the people calling the shots. As built-in analytics was one of the features announced during the keynote, we were eager to talk to Unity's engineers about where Lumos, our own game analytics platform, fits in. Everyone we spoke with, from their CEO David Helgason to the programmers who will be working on the system, was available for discussion and refreshingly honest about their plans. In the tech industry where so many companies guard their words and give statements as useful as Confucius', I appreciated Unity's willingness to give us the lowdown without the bullshit.

The three days of the conference was packed, and other than the exhausting uphill walk to the conference centre we were unable to see much of San Francisco during those days. Fortunately we spent an extra day in SF to be camera-toting tourists. It's a beautiful place that reminded me of Vancouver, a city which I lived in for several years and loved. I'd definitely jump at the opportunity to return to California and take in more of the metropolis. Unite 2012 perhaps?
