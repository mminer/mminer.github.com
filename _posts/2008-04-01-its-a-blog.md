title: "It's A Blog!"
---

Welcome! On this lovely slice of the world wide web I will share my experiences with web design, programming, filmmaking, game development, and other such activities that fill my time. I hope that the posts I make here will be helpful for those interested in such topics, and terribly dull for those who aren't.

Currently a lot of the features I would like to have are missing --- comments, RSS feeds, a site that looks right on Internet Explorer 6 --- but these will come with time. Thanks for visiting, and do enjoy.
