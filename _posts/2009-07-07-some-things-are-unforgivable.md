title: Some Things Are Unforgivable

One of my first assignments at Vancouver Film School was to tell a short story using a series of images, limiting the use of narration. This could be done using drawings or photographs or any other visual medium. I chose to tell my tale using characters cut from construction paper. Each "shot" was taped to the wall then photographed. It was tedious compared to using something like Photoshop and that newfangled cut 'n paste I hear so much about, but the end result was decidedly worth it.

*Some Things Are Unforgivable* tells of a handsome young egg-shaped creature sharing a portion of his past with his parents. It can be viewed [right here](/files/stau.pdf) (PDF).
