Work on the Cutscene Editor has been progressing steadily. The GUI is starting to come together and actually resemble a cutscene editor (whatever the heck that looks like; I conveniently have no point of comparison). Building the editor window controls has been frustrating at times, but ultimately rewarding. Frustrating because the documentation can leave much to be desired. Rewarding because the ability to extend the editor is sensational. It's like a roller coaster, but it code form and without the long lineups.

Above is a screenshot of the current version. Let's call it 0.1. If it looks terribly unusable, that's because it is. But don't you fret, *it will be awesome*.
