title: "Announcing Lumos Game Analytics"
---

Recently myself and other suave folks have been building a game analytics service called Lumos. Frustrated by the lack of analytic tools geared specifically towards the needs of game developers, we took up the task of building one ourselves. The result of our efforts is now in public beta, and I encourage you to [take it for a spin](http://www.uselumos.com/).
