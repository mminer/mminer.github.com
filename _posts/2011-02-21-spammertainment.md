I have to give credit to spammers, occasionally they display creativity I thought impossible from people with such atrocious grammar. For amusement I sometimes take a gander at the spam comments this blog receives. This latest batch cleverly takes into account the title of the post.

> Changing unitys boilerplate script code.. Slap-up

Slap-up indeed. If the comment didn't link to a site advertising toaster ovens, I'd be tempted to approve it to show my appreciation of the excellent word choice. Ditto for this one:

> Cutscene editor on github.. Corking

Do senior citizens read my blog now? Here's another one I enjoyed:

> Your webpage appears to be excellent. Possess a decent morning.

*Possessing* a decent morning sounds much more fulfilling than simply having one. Some spam comments though don't quite hit the mark, like this one in response to a post about Unity coroutines:

> Thanks for taking the time to talk about this, I feel fervently about this and I get pleasure from learning about this topic. [...] I have found it very helpful. There've to become charging stations everywhere.

I'm flattered that a topic as mundane as coroutines can be so enthralling. That last sentence about charging stations is cryptic though. How many blog posts could such a sentence apply to? The believability of the comment would be much higher if only that bit was omitted. And if it didn't link to a shady site selling organ-engorging medications.

Now, here's a pro tip for spammers. Some of your comments are genuinely convincing. If they weren't flagged for review by [Akismet](http://akismet.com/), I'd have difficulty determining their legitimacy. The URLs supplied in the homepage field are a dead giveaway of your true intentions though. If they contain terms related to pornography, or credit cards, or cheap jewellery, it's a strong hint that you don't actually feel fervently about the articles I write.
