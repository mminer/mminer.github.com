Earlier I [posted the script](/2009/a-musical-script/) fashioned for my end-of-year motion picture at Vancouver Film School. The finished product has been in the can and uploaded to the world wide web for some time now, but I never bothered to spread the word. But now I'm bothering, and I invite you to enjoy my humble attempt at a musical.
