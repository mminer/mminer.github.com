title: "Methodic Branding Refresh"
---

The Unity Asset Store recently updated their image size requirements, so I took the opportunity to give the branding for [Methodic](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/954) a fresh coat of paint. Here's the old hero graphic:

I was going for minimalism, but let's be real, it's dreary stuff. For a refresh I wanted an isometric style, if for no other reason than I had just visited [Cmd's website](https://cmd.com) and dug the look (it's a real sexy home page, very "competent cyberpunk").<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>

I outsourced the graphic design to [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com). This was my first time using a freelancer marketplace (believe it or not, that old Methodic branding was made in-house). I roughed out this quick sketch for the designer to work from:

I'm trying to communicate that Methodic allows you to run your game code via a GUI. I don't think it totally succeeds, but in any case the designer [mdaproject](https://www.fiverr.com/mdaproject) did a fantastic job turning my clumsy napkin doodle into a polished graphic.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup>

The turnaround was quick and the designer was responsive when I requested tweaks. Painless experience overall. Will use Fiverr again.

    <li id="fn1">The isometric aesthetic is definitely in right now. It'll probably look dated come the new year, but hey that's fashion baby.</li>
    <li id="fn2">There are pages and pages of talented designers on Fiverr producing isometric graphics. A nice perk of jumping on a bandwagon is that you have plenty of options.</li>
