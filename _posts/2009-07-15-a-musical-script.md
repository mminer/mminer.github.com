title: A Musical Script

For my final project at Vancouver Film School, I created a short comedic musical titled *The Contrivance of Dr. Bromegrass*. It tells the tale of a lovable mad scientist who has his medical license revoked after performing unorthodox experiments. He finds himself losing hope in his work until inspiration comes in the form of his idol, Thomas Edison. To gain back the respect of the scientific community, he seeks to come up with the Ultimate Scientific Creation. I went all experimental and included credits at the end. Nobody does that these days.

Now that I've ruined the plot, I figure releasing the script won't cause any more damage. While the film can't be shown just yet (doing so could make it ineligible for some festivals), I invite you to check out the [text version](/files/codb.pdf) of the movie (PDF).

In the future I reckon I'll make a post about my experiences making a musical. It was certainly a challenge, but most definitely worth it. Every movie should be a musical.
